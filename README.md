# Abstract

Half a century has passed since Chomsky’s theory of language acquisition, Green and colleagues’ first natural language processor Baseball, and the Brown Corpus creation.
Yet we have not solved the challenge of using computers to understand human language.
We argue that this has occurred because exponential increases in computational power over the last five decades have led us to rely instead on a variety of applied mathematical models designed to exploit raw computational power, diverting us from our theoretical study of language.  
In support of this view, we provide empirical evidence for the limitations of n-gram analyses and three leading natural language processing question-answering systems, and conclude by advocating for using computational power to support linguistic and cognitive approaches to natural language understanding.
